Description:
-
The Boston Housing dataset provides insights into the housing market and factors influencing housing prices. Key attributes include crime rate, zoning, proximity to business areas, environmental factors like nitric oxides concentration, average number of rooms, and socio-economic indicators such as the percentage of lower-status population.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is conducted to gain insights into the dataset:
-

Data Inspection:
-
Checking data types, missing values, and initial exploration of the dataset.

Summary Statistics:
-
Calculating mean, median, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for each attribute.

Data Visualization:
-
Creating visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to understand variable distributions and relationships.

Correlation Analysis:
-
Identifying relationships between features and the target variable.

Outlier Detection:I
-
entifying and addressing outliers.

Data Preprocessing:
-
Scaling, normalizing, or encoding features as required for modeling.

Data Analysis Tasks
-
Average Rooms per Dwelling by MEDV Category: Calculating the average number of rooms per dwelling for each category of 'MEDV' (low, medium, high).
Percentage of Houses Bound to Charles River: Determining the percentage of houses that bound the Charles River.
# NumPy Operations
Performing NumPy operations on the 'AGE' column:
-

Compute mean and standard deviation.

Normalize the array.

Conclusion
The EDA reveals important insights:
-
Price Distribution: Housing prices exhibit a right-skewed pattern.

Correlation Analysis:
-
Features like number of rooms and percentage of lower status population show strong correlations with housing prices.


Geographical Trends: 
-
Exploring housing prices across different areas may reveal localized patterns.

Data Quality:
-
Ensuring data reliability and accuracy is essential.

# CONCLUSION:

Based on the comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on the Boston Housing dataset, several key conclusions emerge. Firstly, the distribution of housing prices exhibits a right-skewed pattern, indicating a prevalence of lower-priced houses compared to higher-priced ones. Correlation analysis reveals strong relationships between certain features such as the number of rooms and the percentage of lower-status population with housing prices, suggesting their significant impact on property values. Moreover, the presence of outliers underscores the need for careful consideration, as they can disproportionately influence statistical analyses and machine learning models. Exploring geographical trends in housing prices across different areas of Boston could unveil localized patterns, offering valuable insights for real estate investment strategies. Ensuring data reliability and accuracy through meticulous examination of missing values, data inconsistencies, and quality issues is paramount. Overall, the EDA process provides a robust understanding of the Boston housing dataset, enabling stakeholders such as real estate investors, policymakers, and urban planners to make well-informed decisions and derive actionable insights for various applications.
